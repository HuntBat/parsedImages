# Image Gallery with Unsplash and Pexels APIs
This is a JavaScript application that uses the Unsplash and Pexels APIs to retrieve and display a gallery of images based on a user's search query. The user can enter a search query into the input field and submit the form to retrieve up to 6 images from both APIs. The images are displayed in the HTML gallery element with the class "gallery", and each image is wrapped in a link that points to the page of the respective owner.
